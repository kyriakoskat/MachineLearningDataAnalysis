Weather Prediction: Will it Rain Tomorrow? â˜”

This project explores weather forecasting using machine learning classification algorithms. By utilizing a dataset with historical weather data, the aim is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on today's weather conditions.

Features:
Preprocessing of weather data (handling missing values, scaling, etc.)
Implementation of various classification models
Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Visualization of results and feature importance

Dataset:
The dataset contains historical weather observations and includes features such as:
Temperature
Humidity
Wind Speed
Atmospheric Pressure
The target variable is RainTomorrow, which indicates whether it will rain the next day.

Models Used:

Naive Bayes

KNeighborsClassifier

Logistic Regression

MLP

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
